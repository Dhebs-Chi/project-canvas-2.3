Project:HTML5 Canvas Shape Editor with TypeScript

Project Overview:
This project allows users to draw shapes (rectangles and custom polygons) on an HTML5 canvas and interactively edit their paths. Users can move, resize, or adjust the corners of shapes directly on the canvas, creating a dynamic, real-time editing experience. The project is built with HTML5, CSS, and TypeScript to manage the logic for shape creation and path editing.

Features:
Shape Drawing: Draw basic shapes like rectangles and custom polygons.
Interactive Path Editing: Click and drag shape corners to adjust dimensions and move shapes around the canvas.
Real-Time Updates: The canvas updates dynamically as the user interacts with the shapes.

Additional Options:
Color Selection: Change the fill color of shapes.
Stroke Settings: Adjust the color and width of the shape's border.
Save Canvas as Image: Download the canvas content as a PNG image.

Technologies Used:
HTML5: For rendering the canvas element and setting up the basic structure.
CSS: For styling the page and the canvas.
TypeScript: For managing the shape creation logic, user input handling, and canvas rendering.
JavaScript: Automatically compiled from TypeScript to handle shape interactions and rendering.
How to Use:
Clone or Download the Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file.


Draw and Edit Shapes:

Select the shape type (Rectangle or Polygon) to draw on the canvas.
Once a shape is drawn, you can drag its corners to resize it or move the shape by dragging the whole object.
The canvas will update in real-time based on your actions.
Change the fill color using the color picker and adjust the stroke width and stroke color.
You can save the canvas as an image by clicking the Save Canvas button.

Interact with the Canvas:

Shapes are draggable, and their corners are adjustable, allowing you to easily resize and modify them.
You can change the stroke and fill properties for each shape individually.

Note that for it to work effectively, you must first select the drawn image before applying color picker, stroke width, border radius, rotate and resize.
